# General Linear _F_ Test

## Practice Problems

1. Carry out general linear F test to assess if we can drop x7 x8 x9 from the model with all predictors.

$H_0: \beta_7 = \beta_8 = \beta_9 = 0, H_a: \text{ at least one coefficient in }H_0\text{ is not zero.}$

```{r}
((113.91+10.01+33.84)/3)/(2172.59/29)
```

So $F_0 = 0.7019$

p value is
```{r}
1-pf(0.7019,3,29)
```


critical value is:

```{r}
qf(1-0.05, 3, 29)
```
Since $F_0 < F_{\text{crit}}$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The data do not support the alternative hypothesis, the full model, so we go with the reduced model (without $x_7$,$x_8$,$x_9$)

2. The value of $SS_R(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ is given by:

```{r}
0.22+82.55+3112.40
```

3. Value of $SS_{res}(x_1,x_2,x_3)$:

```{r}
(0.22+82.55+3112.40)-2172.59
```

4. Value of $SS_{res}(x_1,x_2,...,x_8)$:

```{r}
2172.59+33.84
```
